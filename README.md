# freeCodeCamp Survey Form Challenge
*__This is the code for the freeCodeCamp "Survey Form" challenge I completed on Codepen.__*

*The code is raw, unrefactored.* Since this was a code challenge I was trying to complete, I didn't delete the commented out code in any file because I was more concerned with learning, experimenting, and completing the challenge than commented out code affecting the code's appearance.  

I also left in the commented out code so that I can:
* keep from trying the same code that didn't work again
* retry it, reuse it
* to experiment with
* generate new ideas from

**Instructions:**

None.

**Note:**

There is no action attribute in the opening form tag so the form wont do anthing. The form was created to show that I know how to create the skeletal structore of the form to complete the freeCodeCamp challenge. 

**Side Note:**

If you have any suggestions on how to improve my code, or how I can or what I can do to become a better web developer, feel free to send me a message.
